# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project-T.O.P.
The purpose of this project is to make a  Rock-Paper-Scissors game between the player and the computer. Since it's on the very basic stage, for now it's play on the browser's console.
It has a filler text in the HTML file, and the explanations for the code's mechanics are in the comments. I tried to be as clear as possible. 
For anyone curious, I made a mistake in the comparing of the players' choices. Since they were converted to lowercase, I was supposed to put the computer choice in lowercase, right? Well, I totally forgot that and put the conditional with a capital letter at the start. The game will never work that way. I rewrote the function 3 times before I realized.
